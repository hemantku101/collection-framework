# Diiffrence between HashSet, LinkedhashSet, TreeSet

**HashSet**
1-It is an implementation of hashing trchnique with array representation.
2-It occupie less memory.
3-It is an UnorderedSet.
4-It allow null value.

**LinkedHashSet**
1-It is an implementation of hashing technique with linked representation.
2-It occupies more memory because data stored in nodes.
3-It is an ordered set.
4-It allows null value.

**TreeSet**
1-It is an Implementation of binary search tree technique with linked representation.
2-It occupies more memory because data stored in nodes.
3-It is a shorted set.
4-It does not allow null value.
