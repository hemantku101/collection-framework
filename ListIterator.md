# ListIterator
1-It is used to iterate elements of a collection.

2-ListIterator is a sub-interface of Iterator in Java that extends the functionality of the basic Iterator.

3-It is used to traverse a list, which can be either a LinkedList or an ArrayList, in either forward or backward direction.

4-It provides additional methods such as previous(), hasPrevious(), add(), and set(). 
The add() method is used to insert an element into the list at the current position of the iterator, 
while the set() method is used to replace the last element returned by the iterator.
ListIterator can be obtained using the listIterator() method provided by the List interface.
