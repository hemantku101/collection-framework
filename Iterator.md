# Iterator

1-It is used to iterate element of collection.
2-In Java, an Iterator is an interface provided by the java.util package that allows iterating over a collection 
in a safe and efficient way. It provides a uniform way of iterating over any type of collection such as ArrayList, HashSet, LinkedList, etc. 
An iterator is used to traverse or iterate through the elements of a collection and perform operations on them.

3-The Iterator interface provides three methods:

hasNext(): returns a boolean indicating whether the iteration has more elements.
next(): returns the next element in the iteration.
remove(): removes the last element returned by the iterator.
