# Differences between HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap

**HashMap**

-1-It is an implementation of hashing technique with array representation.
2-It occupies less memory.
3-It is an unordered map.
4-It allows one null key and many null values.

**LinkedHashMap**

1-It implementation of hashing technique with linked representation.
2-It occupie more memory because data stored in nodes.
3-It is an ordered map.
4-It allows one null key and many null values.

**TreeMap**
1-It is an implementation binary search tree technique with linked representation.
2-It occupies more memory because data stored in nodes.
3-It is a sorted map.
4-It is does not allow null key and allows null values.
